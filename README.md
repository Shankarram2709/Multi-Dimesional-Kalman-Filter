# Multi-Dimesional-Kalman-Filter

Implementation of Kalman filter for multi dimension for fusion between two sensors IMU and GPS 

Estimated states are x,y direction and their corresponding rotation angles. 

Can be used upto the estimation of 6 dimensions but Matrixes should be altered based on the estimation


Default sample measurement used but can also be used with real time measurements captured from the sensors.
